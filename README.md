# LilouStoryBot

This repository holds a dual project that I started with Moise 
This bots main purpose is to automate the process of making those
tiktok stories videos that most of us probably stumbled upon.
The video made by the bot will be split screen videos. 

The first top portion of the video is the actual story with a voiceover.
The second bottom portion of the video is a random minecraft playthrough.

Our idea is to automate these 2 process. 

	Automate the creation of the video with the voiceover.

	Automate the minecraft playthrough.

	Finally, Combine these 2 videos together.
